**This is fiction.** Rosalind Ffoulkes-Mbeki does not exist, the Vale Wanderers
did not exist, and no photograph below was ever taken. Every artifact this
script writes carries ``origin="fixture:first-bite"``, the playground is a
temporary directory removed on exit, and nothing outside it is written. A
fixture that could be mistaken for a real trail is a forged record, and the
thing this box sells is a trail.

What this is
------------
Every other demo in the fleet proves one organ. ``the_dogfooding`` points
Nestor at its own decisions; ``two_desks`` asks what a second matcher does to a
human surface; the gate demo shows a receipt refusing to be edited. None of
them needs more than one part of the box, which is why the box has never been
demonstrated as one thing.

This follows a single thread that cannot be walked without all of them:
somebody wants a small tool, and the box is honest at every step. The Forge
loop is the right thread because it is the only one with **ground truth that
arrives on its own** — the thing clears the bar or it does not, and no opinion
enters.

The beats, in dependency order. Each is what the next one assumes:

    1  the ask            a sentence with two keywords and no spec
    2  look in the box    Nestor, then the box, then remote — and it finds one
    3  she builds anyway  a preference. no procedure verifies a preference.
    4  the playground     work happens where work belongs, not in the product
    5  the build          sandboxed, network-isolated
    6  it wants the web   three keys, and exactly one of them is hers
    7  the review         adversarial, and it may say nothing at all
    8  the bar            promote_check — and it fails on the gate 39/42 fail
    9  the demo           the artifact that clears the bar is a demo. recursion.
   10  the seal           a hand. one tap. wherever she is.
   11  the calibration    the box finds out whether it was right

WHAT IT IS ALSO FOR
-------------------
The friction log is the second output and the more useful one. This walks the
day a person would actually have, and records every place the box asks for
something a person does not have, or answers in a language nobody speaks. A
demo that only shows the happy path is a brochure. On a box where the Forge has
never run, most of these beats will report MISSING, and the ordered list of what
is missing is a punch list that happens to read as a story.

"""demo/the_first_bite.py runs the loop it describes.

Runs the demo as a subprocess (`--json --pace off`, so the content is what a
person sees, silently) with the fleet keyring unset and FORGE_HOME sandboxed
by the demo itself, then reads the facts it emits beside the friction log.
Beats 1 and 11 must report no friction when Nestor is installed; without it
they must say so as MISSING, honestly, rather than crash.

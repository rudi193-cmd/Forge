"""Issue #7: measure_panel walked tool caches, so `.mypy_cache` could manufacture
a convergent finding and route to human_required.

The reproduction from the issue, as a test: two tiny sources plus one 400 KB
tool-cache database. Before the fix the cache satisfied BOTH default
instruments at once — byte-share dominator (census) and a `.db` smell
(hygiene) — which is precisely the independent-agreement condition convergence
exists to detect, raised about a file no maker wrote.

"""Tests for forge.trust — the forge's promotion trust as a §0.2 mechanism.

Skips if the cloud seam is absent (the module fail-closes on import). With it
present, this proves `verified_by` is no longer a string: enrollment is a
provisional gate-bound seal, ratification is a checkpoint signed by the
verifier's key, and `witnessed` refuses a same-hand or wrong-key ratification.

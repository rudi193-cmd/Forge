"""forge/instrument_callgraph.py — the measuring panel's first REAL fleet
instrument: `codebase-memory-mcp`'s call graph (docs/design/the-forge-measure.md).

The box's decoy — `login.php`'s `check_login()`, retrieved by every ranker as
"where auth lives," and never actually called — was caught by exactly one kind
of tool: one that traced the CALL GRAPH (`fan_in=0`) instead of ranking by
appearance. `codebase-memory-mcp` is that tool (rule 11: reuse it, don't rebuild
a tree-sitter graph). This adapter drives it one-shot via its `cli --json`
surface, finds functions with no callers, and emits a per-file `Finding` the
panel can converge with `census`/`hygiene` — a dead function in a file that is
ALSO an accidental commit is a much louder signal than either alone.

**Dead code = set difference, not a broken OPTIONAL-count.** codebase-memory's
query engine returns `count(a)=1` for an OPTIONAL MATCH that matched nothing
(verified), so fan_in can't be read from one aggregate. Instead: all functions
MINUS the targets of any `CALLS` edge, minus entry points (a genuine root is
not dead) and language builtins. That set difference is the pure, tested core
(`_dead_functions`); the subprocess plumbing around it degrades to
`InstrumentUnavailable` on any failure (binary absent, non-zero exit, unreadable
output) — the panel's honest-coverage path, never a crash.

**Issue #9 — format drift must not read as clean.** The first cut parsed the
tool's indented TEXT table. The tool moved to compact JSON; the text parser
yielded the whole payload as one row, the "malformed row" guard skipped it,
and the instrument reported *found nothing* on every codebase — routing a
*could-not-read* into the *looked-and-saw-nothing* bucket, which is precisely
the distinction the panel exists to protect. Now: the query result is read as
JSON (`structuredContent.rows`, with the `content[0].text` JSON as the
fallback), the CLI is called through `--args-file` (the raw-JSON argument
form is deprecated upstream), and a payload the reader cannot make rows of —
or one that reports `total > 0` while yielding no rows — raises
`InstrumentUnavailable`, so the panel says COULD NOT RUN rather than clean.
A panel that reports clean is worse than one that reports uncovered, because
uncovered is actionable and clean is not.

Not in the panel's dependency-free DEFAULT_INSTRUMENTS: this needs the external
binary (downloaded on first use, runs a daemon), so a caller opts in
(`measure_panel` CLI `--with-callgraph`, or pass `CallGraphInstrument()`
explicitly). When it is NOT included, the panel names `call-graph` as an
uncovered class — the sigmap honesty.
